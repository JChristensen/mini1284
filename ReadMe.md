# The Mighty Mini 1284P #

A minimal breadboard-friendly design for the ATmega1284P MCU, named after [maniacbug's "mighty-1284p" Arduino core](http://goo.gl/iBJMnJ), in recognition of his contribution to the Arduino community. It has all necessary support components, ICSP and FTDI headers, and all GPIO pins are brought out to headers.

05May2014 - An updated version of maniacbug's mighty-1284p core based on Arduino 1.0.5 is available [here](http://goo.gl/l7cPbX).

Printed circuit boards can be [ordered through OSH Park](http://goo.gl/ZxooPW).

A bill of materials is [available on Mouser](http://goo.gl/hXERzO).

I'd be interested to hear from anyone that builds one.
