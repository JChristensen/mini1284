# The Mighty Mini 1284P #

A minimal breadboard-friendly design for the ATmega1284P MCU and named after [maniacbug's Arduino core for the 1284P](http://goo.gl/iBJMnJ), to recognize his contribution to the Arduino community.

Printed circuit boards can be [ordered through OSH Park](http://goo.gl/ZxooPW).

A bill of materials is [available on Mouser](http://goo.gl/hXERzO).

I'd be interested to hear from anyone that builds one.
