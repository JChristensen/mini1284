# The Mighty Mini 1284P v1.1#

A minimal breadboard-friendly design for the ATmega1284P MCU, named after [maniacbug's "mighty-1284p" Arduino core](http://goo.gl/iBJMnJ), in recognition of his contribution to the Arduino community. It has all necessary support components, ICSP and FTDI headers, and all GPIO pins are brought out to headers.

v1.1 differs from v1.0 only in that a different crystal and different value loading capacitors are used.

05May2014 - An updated version of maniacbug's mighty-1284p core based on Arduino 1.0.5 is available [here](http://goo.gl/l7cPbX).

Printed circuit boards can be [ordered through OSH Park](http://goo.gl/QvPN2v).

A bill of materials is [available on Mouser](http://goo.gl/KgAAyT).

I'd be interested to hear from anyone that builds one.
